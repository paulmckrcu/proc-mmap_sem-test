1.	C-language process remaps its memory incessantly, complaining
	if any given mapping or unmapping operation takes too long
	(say longer than 5 seconds).

	a.	Use MAP_ANONYMOUS to avoid needing to create a file.
		Use MAP_PRIVATE.  Use MAP_POPULATE.  Set fd to -1.

	b.	Do an initial large mapping to establish the area
		of the address space that will be used.
		
	c.	Use MAP_FIXED for mappings in the loop.

2.	Script puts #1 in background, niced moderately.

3.	Same script creates a child that scans /proc/PID/smaps
	incessantly.  This is niced as low as possible.

4.	Script creates one CPU-bound process per CPU, running at
	highest possible niceness.  These terminate after some time,
	say ten seconds.  When they terminate, the top-level script
	waits some time (again, say ten seconds) then creates a
	new set.
